This is the *My First Project with Python* project I made myself.

This program can automate your account management routine.

<p>Imagine that you're the owner of a new small corner shop. You are doing well and want to determine how much you earned in the first month. Create a simple tool that will calculate your net income. Upon completing this project, you can use this tool for your own accounting needs.</p><br/><br/>
